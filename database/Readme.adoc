= Subscriptions database

This folder contains the Dockerfile and init script to generate a PostgreSQL database with a table.
This table is intended to hold the "Subscriptions" model.

Building and starting scripts are provided.

Both scripts allow using the `-h` flag to display some usage tips.

== Intended usage

Build the image running:

[source, bash]
----
./build_image.sh
----

This script also allows the `-v` flag, to specify an image tag (defaults to *latest*).

Start a container running:

[source, bash]
----
./start_container.sh
----

This script also allows the `-v` flag, to specify the image tag (defaults to *latest*) and the `-p` tag to specify the port that Docker will fordward to PostgreSQL's listening port (defaults to *65432*).

== Other notes

The image can be built and run normally, as it is a regular Docker image.
